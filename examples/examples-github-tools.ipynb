    "\n",
    "1. **Git Status Overview**: Shows modified, staged, and untracked files\n",
    "2. **Change Summary**: Displays file change statistics with addition/deletion counts  \n",
    "3. **Staged Changes**: Complete diff of all staged changes ready to commit\n",
    "4. **Unstaged Changes**: Complete diff of all working directory changes\n",
    "5. **Safe Untracked File Handling**: \n",
    "   - Automatically detects and skips binary files (images, executables, etc.)\n",
    "   - Limits file size display (skips files >100KB)\n",
    "   - Shows file sizes for context\n",
    "   - Respects .gitignore patterns for untracked files\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool is particularly useful for:\n",
    "- **Pre-commit reviews**: Understanding exactly what changes will be committed\n",
    "- **Debugging workflows**: Seeing the complete state of your working directory\n",
    "- **Code reviews**: Getting comprehensive diffs before creating pull requests\n",
    "- **Safe file inspection**: Avoiding issues with binary files or oversized content"

    "\n",
    "1. **Code Review Analysis**: Use `get-github-pull-request-info` to quickly understand the scope and impact of changes in a PR\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Automated Reports**: Extract PR information for generating automated review reports or documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Change Impact Assessment**: Review file changes and diffs to understand the impact of proposed changes\n",

    "### Prerequisites Reminder\n",
    "\n",
    "For the GitHub tools to work properly, ensure you have:\n",
    "- GitHub CLI installed: `brew install gh` (macOS) or visit https://cli.github.com/\n",
    "- Authenticated with GitHub: `gh auth login`\n",
    "- Access to the repositories you want to analyze (public repos work without additional setup)\n",
